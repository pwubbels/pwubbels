Hi there, I'm Peter 👋

I'm a software engineering leader with a passion for building intelligent products that improve lives. 

I spent ten years at Google where I launched its business offering, helped crowd-source Street View with computer vision and consumer cameras, and delivered Alphabet's first AI-based medical diagnostic device.

I'm currently part of the executive leadership team, and responsible for the engineering org at a health tech startup focused on lowering US healthcare costs via incentivized, proactive screening.

What I'm Up To 🌱
+ 🧗🏃 When I'm not working, you can probably find me at the rock climbing gym or outside running.

+ 🧠 On nights and weekends, I'm currently exploring the possibilities of AI and prototyping an idea in the rock climbing space.
